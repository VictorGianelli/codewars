## Description
Your crazy uncle has found a new hobby - he will occasionally scream out random words of the same length. Since he was a renowned Computer Scientist, you think he must have some pattern to this craziness. The words seem to always have a few letters in the same place, so maybe if you find his pattern his new amusement will stop annoying you.

Your task then, is to design a function letter_pattern that takes in a list of strings (all lowercase, and only including letters). It should return a string with every letter that is always there in place.

## Example
```['war', 'rad', 'dad']``` should return ```"*a*"```, since only the second place stays constant

```['general', 'admiral', 'piglets', 'secrets']``` should return ```"*******"```

```['family']``` should return ```"family"```
